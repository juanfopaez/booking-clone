This web application is built with Next.js using create-next-app and incorporates Shadcn, Tailwind CSS, and Next.js 14 for a powerful and efficient development experience, you can visit https://booking-clone-roan.vercel.app/ to learn moar about that!

```

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
